# Development Server using Browsersync and Gulp.js

After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) open your Terminal (Mac) or CMD (Windows) and navigate to the folder
you saved the 'dev-server' folder.

From there run the command "npm install" which will get all dependencies. After that run "npm start", this will open up
you default brower on http://localhost:3000. Port number may vary depending on your connection so check your Terminal or CMD
for which port it is connected on.
